	<p><b>Favorite movie and music of all time</b></p>
	<img src="img/images.jpg" width="440">
	<p>Out of all the movies that I have watched in my years, my absolute favorite would be the Disney movie Wall-e. This movie is about a little robot forgotten in the past of humankind is destined to come upon a plant which could eventually revive earth. This is because of how polluted it became by the humans that later on left earth and lived in space on a huge spaceship. This movie explains the importance in having a clean and save enviorment which can help towards having a better lifestyle for yourself and the next generations to come.
